FEATURE IMPORTANCE:
  background_foreground_consistency: 0.2616
  lighting_consistency: 0.2235
  motion_smoothness: 0.1431
  noise_pattern_consistency: 0.1312
  eye_blink_frequency: 0.1115
  facial_boundary_consistency: 0.0914
  micro_expression_presence: 0.0209
  texture_consistency: 0.0103
  color_consistency: 0.0033
  compression_artifacts: 0.0032

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. The most reliable indicators of deepfakes were: background_foreground_consistency, lighting_consistency, motion_smoothness
2. The model correctly identified 96.5% of deepfakes
3. The model correctly recognized 100.0% of authentic media

THREAT ANALYSIS:
1. Current deepfake technology appears most detectable through inconsistencies in
   background_foreground_consistency and lighting_consistency
2. The most advanced deepfakes might now be focusing on improving these aspects
3. Detection techniques will need to evolve as deepfake technology improves

IMPLICATIONS:
1. Media verification systems should focus on the most reliable detection features
2. Multi-modal detection (analyzing audio, metadata, and context) will increase reliability
3. User awareness remains critical as deepfake technology continues to advance

EDUCATIONAL NOTE: This analysis demonstrates how AI can be used to detect
deepfakes. Understanding these techniques helps develop better defenses against
malicious uses of synthetic media technologies.
