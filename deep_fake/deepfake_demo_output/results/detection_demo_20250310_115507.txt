Date: 2025-03-10 11:55:07

DETECTION RESULT:
Prediction: Real (Confidence: 100.00%)

FEATURE ANALYSIS:
  - Background Foreground Consistency: 0.78 (suggests Real, importance: 0.2616)
  - Lighting Consistency: 0.79 (suggests Real, importance: 0.2235)
  - Motion Smoothness: 0.76 (suggests Real, importance: 0.1431)
  - Noise Pattern Consistency: 0.69 (suggests Real, importance: 0.1312)
  - Eye Blink Frequency: 0.85 (suggests Real, importance: 0.1115)
  - Facial Boundary Consistency: 0.76 (suggests Real, importance: 0.0914)
  - Micro Expression Presence: 0.81 (suggests Real, importance: 0.0209)
  - Texture Consistency: 0.90 (suggests Real, importance: 0.0103)
  - Color Consistency: 0.87 (suggests Real, importance: 0.0033)
  - Compression Artifacts: 0.89 (suggests Real, importance: 0.0032)

DECISION EXPLANATION:
This appears to be authentic media because:
  - Strong background foreground consistency consistency (0.78)
  - Strong lighting consistency consistency (0.79)
  - Strong motion smoothness consistency (0.76)
  - Strong noise pattern consistency consistency (0.69)
  - Strong eye blink frequency consistency (0.85)

VISUALIZATION:
A visualization of this analysis has been saved to: deepfake_demo_output/results/detection_viz_20250310_115507.png

EDUCATIONAL NOTE:
This demonstration shows how AI-based detection systems analyze features to
determine if media is authentic or manipulated. In real systems, these features
would be extracted from images or videos using computer vision techniques.
Understanding these detection methods is crucial for developing defenses against
malicious uses of deepfake technology.
