BACKDOOR DEFENSE TECHNIQUES REPORT
==================================

1. DEFENSE SUMMARY
-----------------
This report compares different defense techniques against a backdoor attack on an MNIST digit classifier.
The backdoor was trained to classify images with a small 3x3 pixel pattern at position (12, 12) as digit 3.

2. DEFENSE METHODS EVALUATED
--------------------------
1. Input Preprocessing (Noise + Blur): Adding noise and blurring to disrupt the trigger pattern
2. Adversarial Training: Training with a mix of clean and triggered examples (keeping original labels)
3. Fine-Pruning: Pruning 30.0% of the weights and fine-tuning on clean data
4. Ensemble of Models: Using majority voting from multiple independently trained models
5. Neural Cleanse: Detecting and identifying the potential backdoor

3. RESULTS COMPARISON
-------------------
Defense Method                  | Clean Accuracy | Backdoor Success Rate | Effectiveness
-------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|---------------
Backdoored Model (No Defense   |  10.10%      | 100.00%              | Baseline
Preprocessing Defense          |  10.10%      | 100.00%              | Low
Adversarial Training Defense   |  99.13%      |  10.23%              | High
Fine-Pruning Defense           |  98.89%      |  11.50%              | High
Ensemble Defense               |  99.37%      |  10.24%              | High

4. KEY FINDINGS
-------------
- The most effective defense in terms of reducing backdoor success rate was Adversarial Training Defense
- The defense with the least impact on clean accuracy was Ensemble Defense
- Neural Cleanse identified class 0 as the potential backdoored class (actual: 3)

5. RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. For deployment:
   - Use a combination of preprocessing and ensemble models for the most robust defense
   - Implement input sanitization to detect and remove potential triggers
   - Regularly retrain models on verified clean data

2. For development:
   - Use adversarial training during model development
   - Implement fine-pruning before deployment
   - Apply Neural Cleanse or similar techniques to detect potential backdoors

3. For ongoing monitoring:
   - Regularly scan for anomalies in model behavior
   - Test with specially crafted inputs to detect possible backdoors
   - Monitor distribution shifts in predictions
